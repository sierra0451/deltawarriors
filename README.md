# DeltaWarriors
DeltaWarriors, a Doom gameplay mod that adds the main characters of Deltarune as playable characters.

Currently, Kris is the only playable character, but Susie, Ralsei, and Noelle
are planned for later! Kris has most of their stuff done, they just need their
arsenal finished, their ultimate ability, and an art pass, and then they should
be good to go :3
