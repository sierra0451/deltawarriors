# DeltaWarriors
DeltaWarriors, a Doom gameplay mod that adds the main characters of Deltarune as playable characters.

Currently, Kris is the only one playable, but Susie, Ralsei, and Noelle are planned for later! Kris has most of their stuff done, they just need their arsenal finished, their ultimate ability, and an art pass, and then they should be good as finished :3

## Installation instructions
### Programs needed:
- UZDoom 4.14.3 (download link [here](https://zdoom.org/downloads))
- Shouldn't have to be said, but I'm gonna say it anyway: you need a version of [Doom I or Doom II]((https://store.steampowered.com/app/2280/DOOM__DOOM_II/)). [Freedoom Phase 1 or 2](https://freedoom.github.io/download.html) will also work, though the recommended experience is with the commercial Doom games.

### Steps
1. Download and extract UZDoom
    1. Go to the [download link](https://zdoom.org/downloads), scroll down to UZDoom v4.14.3, and click to download the version appropriate for your operating system (if you don't know what this means, go with Windows).
    2. Extract the .zip file wherever you'd like.
2. Download DeltaWarriors
    1. Go to [DeltaWarriors' GitHub page](https://github.com/sierra0451/deltawarriors). Click on the green "Code" button and click "Download ZIP" to start downloading the mod.
    2. Drag and drop the .zip file onto your uzdoom.exe or load it into your ZDoom launcher of choice, and have fun!

## Basic How-to-Play (an in-mod tutorial is coming at some point, trust </3)
### Tension Points
The single biggest new mechanic introduced by DeltaWarriors (a mechanic borrowed from Deltarune) is Tension Points, or TP. You can gain them by picking up Tension items around the map—Tension Bits, Gems, and Maxes replace Doom's armor bonuses, green armor pickups, and blue armor pickups respectively. Or, just like in Deltarune, you can also gain TP by grazing enemy projectiles (letting them get close to you while still not getting hit by them) or by dealing damage to enemies. Once you gain enough, you can use that TP for various abilities; an example is Kris's shield parry, which costs 40% TP.

### Weapons
- **Slot 1: Sword**
    - Good for getting up close and quickly taking out weaker demons or finishing off stronger ones while saving ammo. They'll slash it out in front of them, able to strike multiple demons at once for decent damage, so it can also work for crowd control. Pairs well with an invulnerability sphere, but without one, getting up close and personal with the forces of Hell can be a dangerous gamble.
- **Slot 2: Revolver**
    - Good for picking off targets from far away. Kris isn't entirely sure how they got it, but considering what they're having to face, they're happy to have it nonetheless. Being a hand-cannon type of weapon, it can deal decent damage at a long range, making it useful for engagements from further away. It does, however, take some time for Kris to cock the hammer, which slows down the rate at which they can put out rounds with it.
- **Slot 3: Pump-action shotgun**
    - Good for dealing big bursts of damage up-close, although slightly slow to follow up on. Its alt-fire is an even bigger blast, although it takes two shells and has such strong recoil that it'll physically knock Kris back, which they may need a second to recover from before readying the shotgun for further firing. The alt-fire... also somehow requires some of their TP? Odd-
- **Slot 4: SMG**
    - Good for dealing a consistent spray of damage, potentially even stunning demons less tolerant to pain. It, however, chews through ammo rather quickly if not used with some level of caution. Kris may also have some difficulty fully controlling the weapon's recoil, given the rapid fire rate.
- **Offhand Ability (default keybind is Q):** Shield parry
    - Costing 40% of their TP, Kris can swing their shield out in front of them and parry a single incoming projectile, knocking it back into the direction they're looking in. If the parried projectile hits another demon, it may do some additional damage.
- **Sliding:**
    - Hold crouch while running to move Kris into a slide. This will preserve some of their momentum (if moving slowly enough, they get a slight speed boost). While sliding, they can slip by smaller enemies and projectiles, and generally be unaffected by outside physical forces like knockback, although friction will slow them down over time.
