# DeltaWarriors
DeltaWarriors, a Doom gameplay mod that adds the main characters of Deltarune as playable characters.

This is a playtest version! Please do not distribute these files to anyone who has not been authorized for the playtest. (that is, anyone not in the group chat lmao)

Currently, Kris is the only playable character, but Susie, Ralsei, and Noelle are planned for later! Kris has most of their stuff done, they just need their arsenal finished, their ultimate ability, and an art pass (btw if there's anyone who'd be willing to help me with spriting, feel free to send them my way), and then they should be good to go :3
